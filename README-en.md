### Quick Start

1. Prepare a computer with Windows 7/8/10/Server 2008 (64-bit) installed.

2. Install [Anaconda 5.2.2](http://www.continuum.io/downloads), please make sure you download **Python 3.7 (64-bit)**.

3. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#production), please register MongoDB as Windows Service.

4. Install [Visual C++  Redistributable Packages for VS2013 (32-bit)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784).

5. Run **install.bat** to install vn.py and all dependencies.

6. Go to folder **examples/CryptoTrader/** and edit those **ABC_connect.json** files with your exchange config. Taking BitMEX_connect.json as an example:
	* apiKey: the API Key of your account provided by BitMEX
	* secretKey: the Secret Key of your account provide by BitMEX 
	* sessionCount: number of sessions and threads you would like to use for RESTFul request
	* symbols: symbols of contract you would like to receive data update from Websocket API 

7. Change the "language" setting in **VT_setting.json** to "english" (otherwise you will see the GUI in Chinese).

8. Start CryptoTrader by running "python run.py", connect to BitMEX and then you are ready to trade!
